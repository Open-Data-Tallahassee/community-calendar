    title: "French Town Farmers Market",
    description:
      "The Frenchtown Heritage Market KCCI Team worked with neighborhood leaders and the CRA to establish a consistently-held farmers market that could alleviate food access issues, promote healthy food consumption, and support sustainable food production. The market launched in April 2014 and was held every Saturday until November. Showing a steady and significant increase in sales and customer volume, the market opened again for the 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 seasons in April. In 2014, the KCCI Catalyst team worked with the CRA to establish a plan for a permanent market structure and established a sustainable business model with support from both public and private partners. The Frenchtown Farmerâ€™s Market is open between 10-2 p.m. on Saturdays. For more information about the Frenchtown Heritage Market, visit www.frenchtownheritage.org or find them on Facebook.",
